## Description
Purrfect Box is an online web app developed to further explore and display our understanding of the rails framework.<br><br>
This project in particular was assigned with the intention to simulate what it would be like to create an actual useable store web application for a business. Considering my obsession with cats, I decided to build a fun little store that sells a variety of different styled boxes for cats to play in.<br><br>
The user has the ability to:
- view the most-reviewed box on the landing page
- view the 3 most recently added boxes on the landing page
- Add, edit, and delete boxes
- Add reviews to individual boxes
